        help
          This exposes support for extended capabilities of the Tegra display
          controller to userspace drivers.

config TEGRA_NVMAP
	bool "Tegra GPU memory management driver (nvmap)"
	default y
	help
	  Say Y here to include the memory management driver for the Tegra
	  GPU, multimedia and display subsystems

config NVMAP_RECLAIM_UNPINNED_VM
	bool "Virtualize IOVMM memory in nvmap"
	depends on TEGRA_NVMAP && TEGRA_IOVMM
	default y
	help
	  Say Y here to enable nvmap to reclaim I/O virtual memory after
	  it has been unpinned, and re-use it for other handles. This can
	  allow a larger virtual I/O VM space than would normally be
	  supported by the hardware, at a slight cost in performance.

config NVMAP_ALLOW_SYSMEM
	bool "Allow physical system memory to be used by nvmap"
	depends on TEGRA_NVMAP
	default y
	help
	  Say Y here to allow nvmap to use physical system memory (i.e.,
	  shared with the operating system but not translated through
	  an IOVMM device) for allocations.

config NVMAP_HIGHMEM_ONLY
	bool "Use only HIGHMEM for nvmap"
	depends on TEGRA_NVMAP && (NVMAP_ALLOW_SYSMEM || TEGRA_IOVMM) && HIGHMEM
	default n
	help
	  Say Y here to restrict nvmap system memory allocations (both
	  physical system memory and IOVMM) to just HIGHMEM pages.

config FB_TEGRA_CMC623
	bool "Samsung CMC623"
	depends on FB_TEGRA

config NVMAP_CARVEOUT_KILLER
	bool "Reclaim nvmap carveout by killing processes"
	depends on TEGRA_NVMAP
	default n
	help
	  Say Y here to allow the system to reclaim carveout space by killing
	  processes. This will kill the largest consumers of lowest priority
	  first.

config NVMAP_CARVEOUT_COMPACTOR
	bool "Compact carveout when it gets fragmented"
	depends on TEGRA_NVMAP
	default y
	help
	  When carveout allocation attempt fails, compactor defragements
	  heap and retries the failed allocation.
	  Say Y here to let nvmap to keep carveout fragmentation under control.

config NVMAP_SEARCH_GLOBAL_HANDLES
	bool "Check global handle list when generating memory IDs"
	depends on TEGRA_NVMAP && !ICS
	default n
	help
	  Say Y here to allow the system to search through memory handles not
	  owned by the caller when generating a memory ID.  This shouldn't be
	  necessary for well-written applications, but is provided for
	  compatibility with legacy applications.
	  If unsure, say N.

config NVMAP_PAGE_POOLS
        bool "Use page pools to reduce allocation overhead"
        depends on ICS && TEGRA_NVMAP
        default y
        help
          say Y here to reduce the alloction overhead, which is significant
          for uncached, writecombine and inner cacheable memories as it
          involves changing page attributes during every allocation per page
          and flushing cache. Alloc time is reduced by allcoating the pages
          ahead and keeping them aside. The reserved pages would be released
          when system is low on memory and acquired back during release of
          memory.

config NVMAP_PAGE_POOL_SIZE
	depends on ICS
        hex
        default 0x0

config NVMAP_VPR

	depends on ICS
        default n
        help
          Say Y here to support NVHDCP upstream and downstream protocols, this
          requires a correctly fused chip to negotiate keys.
